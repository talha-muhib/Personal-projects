# RSA With Python
Implementing RSA in Python. One file shows the implementation from scratch, and the other one uses Python libraries.

To run the `rsa_encryption.py` file if you're on Windows, run the command `python rsa_encryption.py <command line arguments>`  
Use as many command line arguments as you want. If you use no arguments though, the program will raise an exception.  

Apply the same command above for the `rsa_library.py` file.
