# Planetary Orbit Simulation

Created a 2D graphic showing the approximate orbits of the terrestrial planets and gas giants within our solar system.  
All the physics and calculations are not 100% accurate, but the distances are so enourmous that I had to do some rough estimates to get every planet to fit on the screen.  
Regardless, I hope you enjoy the visual and get to appreciate how truly vast our solar system is.  
You can press the SPACE key to toggle between seeing the inner and outer planets.
