# Planetary Orbit Simulation

Created a 2D graphic showing the approximate orbits of the terrestrial and gas giants within our solar system.  
All the physics and calculations are not 100% accurate, but the distances are so enourmous that I had to do some rough estimates to get every planet to fit on the screen.  
Regardless, I hope you enjoy the visual and get to appreciate how truly vast our solar system is.
