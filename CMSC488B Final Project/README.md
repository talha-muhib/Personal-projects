# Dynamic Programming in Haskell

This is my final project for CMSC488B Spring 2022. 
Even though it was a project for a class, I count it as personal because I had full control over the implementation details.

I implemented 5 different problems using dynamic programming:
Fibonacci (classic lol), Longest increasing subsequece, "Buy low, sell high," Rod cutting, Edit string distancing.

Even though these problems have been solved numerous times by others, the goal of this project was implementing them with an emphasis on Haskell's built-in features.
For example, because Haskell does lazy evaluation, it is possible to construct "infinite lists" which can be used for the dynamic programming approach to a problem like fibonacci. All of this is explained in the code.

I have provided the code above, but not the CABAL file.
