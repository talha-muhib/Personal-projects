# Dynamic Programming in Haskell

This is my final project for CMSC488B Spring 2022. 
Even though it was a project for a class, I count it as personal because I had full control over the implementation details.

I implemented 5 different problems using dynamic programming:
Fibonacci (classic lol), Longest increasing subsequece, "Buy low, sell high," Rod cutting, Edit string distancing.

I have provided the code above, but not the CABAL file.
