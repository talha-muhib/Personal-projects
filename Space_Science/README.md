# Space Science With Python
I am following a youtube playlist (by Astroniz) on how to do different astronomical calculations in Python:

I've been interested in astronomy since I was very little, but I never really tried to do any projects on it.  
Hopefully working on these small projects will give me a better understanding and appreciation about the physics amd complexity behind our universe.
