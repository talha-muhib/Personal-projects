PATH FINDING ALGORITHM VISUALIZER

In this project we explore 4 different algorithms and the 
visual differences in their traversals through a graph:
A*
Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)

Once you run this file on your local machine, 
a display window of squares should pop up.

You can click on the window to set squares anywhere you want.
You can right-click on a square to remove it.
Pressing the C key resets the whole grid.

The orange square is your starting point.
The turquoise square is your ending point.

The program won't run unless both start and end points are set.

To run an algorithm, press the SPACE key.
To choose which algorithm to run, read below:
A key selects A*
U key selects UCS
B key selects BFS
D key selects DFS

You will see in your terminal which algorithm 
was picked based on which key you pressed down on.

If you want to terminate the algorithm while it runs, press any key.
Then press C again to reset the grid.

I hope you find this helpful!
