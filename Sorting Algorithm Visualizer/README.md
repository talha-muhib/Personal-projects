# In-place Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Used Pygame to design a visualizer for some in-place sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort. 
Credit to Tech With Tim for the amazing Pygame tutorial. If you want to try out this program, run the Python file sorting.py on your terminal.
