# Kruskal's Algorithm vs. Prim's Algorithm
Created a visualizer in Pygame to show the difference between Kruskal's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm for minimum cost spanning trees.  

NOTE on Kruskal's algorithm:  
A data structure called Union-Find is used to detect cycles while running the algorithm. The disjoint_set.py file shows an array-based implementation.
