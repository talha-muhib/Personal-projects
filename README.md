# Base Conversion Calculator:
Created a calculator in Java that converts any base between 2 and 16. If a user wanted to convert a number from base 2 to 7, the program would first convert the number into base 10, then convert it into base 7.

# N-Sum:
The program determines if a target sum can be acquired using n elements of a given array. If the target is found, it returns a list of numbers that sum up to the target. Otherwise it returns an empty list. (Implemented in Java)
