# Base Conversion Calculator:
Created a calculator in Java that converts any base between 2 and 16. If a user wanted to convert a number from base 2 to 7, the program would first convert the number into base 10, then convert it into base 7.

# Unique Mod Solution:
You're given a range from 1 to n, and you're given two arrays with arbitrary mods (MOD) and arbitrary remainders (REM). The program checks that if you mod a number with every element in the array MOD, will it yield the corresponding remainder in the array REM? (Program created in Java)

# N-Sum:
The program determines if a target sum can be acquired using n elements of a given array. (Implemented in Java)
