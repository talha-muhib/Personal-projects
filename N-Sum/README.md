# N-Sum:
Given an array of n elements, a number k, and a target sum, the program determines if the target sum can be acquired using k elements of the array. If the target is found, it returns a list of numbers that sum up to the target. Otherwise it returns an empty list.
I tried making the structure of the program in such a way that for similar problems, the same code can be used with minimal changes.
For example, I had a version of this project where instead of returning a list of numbers that sum to the target, the project just returns
TRUE or FALSE, depending on whether the sum was valid. The code structure was exactly the same with minimal type changes. Even for problems
like the Additive Number, I believe the same structure will work with minima changes.
